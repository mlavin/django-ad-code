Release History
====================================

Release and change history for django-ad-code

v1.0.0 (Released TBD
------------------------------------

This release adds support for Django 1.8-2.0. Previous versions of Django are no longer
supported.


v0.5.0 (Released 2014-09-07)
------------------------------------

This release adds support for 1.7 and the new style migrations. If you are using Django < 1.7
and South >= 1.0 this should continue to work without issue.

For those using Django < 1.7 and South < 1.0 you'll need
to add the ``SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES`` setting to point to the old South migrations.

.. code-block:: python

    SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
        'adcode': 'adcode.south_migrations',
    }

No new migrations were added for this release but this will be the new location for future migrations. If your
DB tables are up to date from v0.4.X then upgrading to 1.7 and running::

    python manage.py migrate adcode

should automatically fake the initial migration using the new-style migrations.

- Added support for Django 1.7 migrations
- Added customizable AppConfig for Django 1.7
- Refactored signal handling for caching to use the AppConfig if available
- Dropped Django 1.3 support. Minimum version is now Django 1.4.2
- Dropped support for Python 2.6

v0.4.0 (Released 2012-12-19)
